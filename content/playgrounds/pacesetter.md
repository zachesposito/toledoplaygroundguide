Very long playground. Includes picnic tables in shade. Fenced in with an exit near each end.

Wide variety of equipment including seesaws, a large fort made of recycled materials, swings (for very small children), a climbing wall, multiple slides, and a sort of monkey bar course.

## Safety
Because of the long shape it can be tricky to keep an eye on multiple kids if they play in different ends.

## Running 
A path loops around most of the perimeter of the park, about 2 miles per lap.

## Nearby areas of interest
Connected to Sylvania Fossil Park by a walk/bike path.
