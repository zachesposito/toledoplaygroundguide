Very long playground. Includes picnic tables in shade. Fenced in with an exit near each end.

Wide variety of equipment including seesaws, a large fort made of recycled materials, swings (for very small children), a climbing wall, multiple slides, and a sort of monkey bar course.

## Safety
Because of the long shape it can be tricky to keep an eye on multiple kids if they play in different ends. One end opens straight into the parking lot so keep an eye on wandering toddlers.

## Running 
A path loops around most of the perimeter of the park, about 2 miles per lap.

## Nearby areas of interest
Connected to Sylvania Fossil Park by a walk/bike path.
