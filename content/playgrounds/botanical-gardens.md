Nestled in the trees near the north parking lot is a delightful wood-and-rope playground that will thrill and challenge young climbers. Featuring rope bridges, multiple interconnected platforms, and a three-story tower, kids can run wild for an hour or more without touching the ground.

## Safety
Although the structure is high above the ground all platforms are surrounded by adequate fencing or netting to prevent falls.

## Running
There are paved paths around the park but they are not good for running due to being narrow and winding through and around the flora. Lovely for walking though.

## Nearby areas of interest
Kids may also enjoy walking the rest of the park to see beautiful flowers, ponds, and sculptures.
