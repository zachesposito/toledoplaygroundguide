Adjacent to the north parking lot. Biggest structure is a huge web-like climbing net. Features a toddler area at one end.

A few picnic tables available shaded by trees, but the playground itself is not shaded. Rentable shelter and bathroom house nearby.

## Safety
Separated from the parking lot by a tall berm which might discourage wanderers and keeps balls from rolling near cars.

## Running
Ample paved trails available in the park including an explicit 5 km route.

## Nearby areas of interest
The rest of the park is beautiful, and wildlife sightings are common (deer, owls).
